# Gates

Evidence is current only when the command and result are recorded in this file. A focused pass proves only its named scope.

## Active S1 Correctness Gate

- [x] RED: `node --import tsx --test tests/incremental-index-oracle.test.ts`
  passed 3/4 and failed because a `tsconfig.json` alias-only edit did not update
  `src/app.ts` from `src/session.ts` to `other/session.ts`.
- [x] GREEN: the same oracle resolves the final alias, equals a fresh full index,
  and reports `mode=full` for changed context (4/4 passed).
- [x] Scope safety: target-only content scope alone cannot authorize changed-only
  carry-forward; the foreign-source event regression drops vanished rows, while
  zero-change dirty runs still skip adapter startup (focused 4/4 passed).
- [x] Upgrade safety: `extractor_version` includes the indexer-semantics revision;
  a synthetic pre-fix cohort forces one rebuild.
- [x] Focused delta, registry, oracle, perf-formatting tests pass (26/26), and
  bounded `bench:perf -- --scales 200` reports `edit_reindex_ms=383.0` with
  `edit_scan_ms=17.6` as advisory evidence.
- [x] Final-tree `npm run verify` passes: lint/schema drift, install smoke,
  686/686 tests, dogfood 2/2, deterministic bench 78/78 at score 0.9987, and
  the dependency audit gate all completed successfully.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes; final intended-file review remains before checkpointing.
- [x] No owned Parallax UI/test/browser process remains. All 3,939 recent
  `parallax-*` test directories were moved recoverably to
  `~/.Trash/Parallax-Codex-20260831-final-tests.mRZBfq`; no recent match remains.

## Deferred S1 Read-Reduction Gate

Before selective reads, define and enforce emitted-row ownership separately from
`fileContentScope`. Add deterministic file/byte read counts before claiming a
win; timing alone is advisory. Until then every changed-body run stays on the
conservative full-read/full-extraction path.

## Documentation Gate

- [x] `PLAN.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `IMPROVEMENT_OPPORTUNITIES.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and EN/KO/ZH verification/roadmap docs describe the same boundary.
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` loads `PLAN.md` before the historical local handoff.
- [x] `docs/CODEX-NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md` exists and matches current ownership/navigation.
- [x] `npm run docs:lint` passes.

## Dependency Audit Gate

- [x] `npm audit fix` refreshed only lockfile-resolved transitive packages and
  removed all six fixable high-severity findings.
- [x] `npm run audit:dependencies` accepts only the exact four remaining
  high-severity nodes/advisories plus their locked versions/edges, expires at
  `2026-10-01T00:00:00Z`, and fails closed on drift, malformed/failed audit
  execution, or expiry. Low/moderate findings remain outside the high-severity
  threshold instead of being silently promoted into release failures.
- [x] `npm run test:security` passes 9/9, including threshold, drift, expiry,
  command/JSON failure, and secret-safe diagnostic regressions.
- [x] Forced package overrides were rejected: the reachable Transformers /
  ONNX path has no compatible upstream fix to smoke-test, so the exception is a
  time-bounded risk acceptance rather than remediation.
- [x] The canonical final-tree `npm run verify` reached and passed this gate
  with the explicit temporary-exception warning.

## Audited UI Gate

- [x] Native selection buttons are siblings of source/copy controls; rendered
  impact and delta rows contain no nested interactive elements.
- [x] Light-surface selected focus uses `#18735f` (measured 5.29:1 against the
  selected background), while dark controls use the inverse ink token.
- [x] Reduced-motion CSS and scroll behavior are explicit; `popstate` restores
  filter, preset, and path while discrete selection uses browser history.
- [x] PNG export requires a rendered impact path and reports failure for an
  empty map instead of a false `Exported` state.
- [x] `npm run test:ui` passes 12/12. A live Playwright CLI pass exercised
  filtering, native keyboard selection, push/Back restoration, reduced motion,
  focus contrast, valid PNG download, and empty-map failure. Browser fixtures,
  downloads, and processes were cleaned after the pass.

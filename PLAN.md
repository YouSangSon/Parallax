# Plan

Source of truth for the active improvement loop. Detailed backlog lives in
`IMPROVEMENT_OPPORTUNITIES.md`; implementation plans live under
`docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Active Loop

- Next loop: continue D6 pre-commit / pre-push impact-gate installer work.
- Completed slice: D1 official PR action wrapper now runs init/index/pr triage,
  supports changed-file or base/head diff discovery, writes SARIF, and appends a
  GitHub step summary while leaving SARIF upload explicit.
- Completed slice: D7 coverage gaps now emit as SARIF warnings anchored to
  changed files.
- Completed slice: D7 cross-repo contract breaks now emit as SARIF warnings
  anchored to provider contracts.
- Completed slice: D7 adapter known gaps now emit as SARIF note results anchored
  to changed files.
- Completed slice: D7 recommended verification actions now emit as SARIF note
  results.
- Completed loop: D8 dependency PR dogfood now has `parallax pr triage` for
  local diff analysis, SARIF output, `--fail-on`, and repo-map context.
- Completed loop: M9 repo-map hardening now carries omitted query-match counts
  and human CLI output exposes query matches, resource URIs, coverage, and
  provenance.
- Push policy: local commits only until the user explicitly approves push.

## Next

1. Build D6 pre-commit / pre-push impact-gate installer.
2. Keep D4 deep-linkable UI/export queued for human sharing.
